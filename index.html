          <p class="title">The Illuminati Is Behind Everything</p>
          <p>The show is believed to have many ties to the infamous organization, the Illuminati. For example, the antagonist from the first season of the show was named Bill Cipher. Cipher was a dream demon that was clearly designed after the Eye of the Providence, which was a common symbol that the Illuminati used in their meetings. If you were to play a certain game online, it would reveal that there was indeed a secret organization in Gravity Falls, but it doesn't exactly state what their goals are. (However, it was revealed in the season 2 episode 'Society of the Blind-eye' that the organization was called the Society of the Blind-Eye, a group dedicated to erasing the memories of the townsfolk from supernatural encounters, keeping them happy and ignorant.)

            It is also believed that Stan was either a member of this organization, or even the head of it.</p>

          <p class="title">Bill's Portal</p>
          <p>Okay, first of all, look at the portal. Now, flip Bill upside-down. See what I mean? Also, Bill's wheel looks a lot like the four rings around the portal. So, it's only suitable to say that, since we know he's a bit full of himself, that he modeled the portal to look like himself. Also, there's a strange symbol on the side of the computer. It flashes in his face after being summoned by Gideon. Also, there is a shooting star, a lima, and a pine tree as one of the flashing symbols when Stan turns on the portal.</p>

          <p class="title">Six-Fingered Pyramid</p>
          <p>Now, let's talk about Bill's hands. On both hands, he has six fingers in some scenes. Also, Bill knows Stan too well, like a business partner. Sound familiar? Stan had a friend who knew about the portal, and how to operate it. After turning on the portal, Bill when in a became an all seeing eye.</p>

        <div class="card">
          <p class="title">The Leader of the Society of the Blind Eye</p>
          <p>Soon, Bill created the S.o.t.B.E to make sure that people who knew about him would forget him so he could continue his plans to rule the world with his three books of tyrant power. So, he wiped Stan and others afterwards to continue his plans. After he wiped people clean, he activated the portal one more time to unleash monsters. But, the government took the portal, misused it, and killed the all knowing Bill, turning him into a demon.</p>

          <p>Tumblr user darkpoisonouslove points out that the shapeshifter shows Dipper the last form he will ever take. Coincidentally, it's the same form he takes when he turns to wood in "Northwest Mansion Mystery." This makes it seem like Dipper is supposed to perish in this form, but he has found a way to change his fate. They believe this "was how [Dipper's] life was supposed to end. But it didn't. Because he was willing to look beneath the surface and made an effort to understand Pacifica."

            Dipper and Pacifica don't get along in the beginning, but as they get to know each other in this episode, they understand each other better. By being nice to Pacifica, Dipper changes what will happen in the end, causing Pacifica to open the gate and save his life.

          <p>Mrs. Gleeful doesn't appear in the show too often, but whenever she does, she seems traumatized. Redditor /u/Joe_Kerr_99 suggests that this could be a result of Gideon's power. They propose, "After Gideon found Journal 2 and found the Magic Amulet, Gideon's mother found out about it and Gideon used the Amulet to mess with her mind."

            This would explain her constant terrified expression. At one point in the show, she even says, "Just keep vacuuming," as if to show that she is actually scarred by something that happened between her and her son, and is conditioned to obey him.</p>

          <p class="title">Bill Accidentally Saves The Future Rather Than Ruining It</p>
          <p>At the end of the show, Bill ends Time Baby and all of the time travelers. This might seem like a bad thing, but Redditor /u/ForeignCod poses an interesting theory. In the episode "The Time Traveler's Pig," Dipper and Mabel accidentally end up in the future, where Time Baby is destroying the world. Therefore, by taking Time Baby out of the equation, it's possible that Bill has stopped the real end of the world without realizing it.

            The Redditor writes, "In Weirdmaggedon, Bill [ends] Time Baby. Whether intentional or not, Bill saves the future. I'm thinking it might've been intentional."

          <p class="title">Bill Cipher Survived And Is Living In Grunkle Stan's Mind</p>
          <p>While Gravity Falls has a heartwarming ending, it seems a bit odd that Grunkle Stan gains his memories back so quickly. In a YouTube video by the Film Theorists, he suggests that Bill is likely still alive inside Stan's mind, controlling him while he sleeps. While hints are scattered throughout the show, the main clue is in the third journal itself:"
            It turns out that the memory-ray's effects can be undone through exposure to important images and people from your past. The reason Stan recovered so much faster is that we began recovery while the erasure was still fresh - Less than an hour after contact."</p>

          <p class="title">Grunkle Stan Only Loses Some Memories</p>
          <p>When Ford erases Stan's memories, he types "Stanley Pines" into the machine. As Redditor /u/ToxicDragon200 points out, he probably only loses memories associated with that name. Stan has gone by many names throughout his life, and while he is with Mabel and Dipper he goes by Stanford Pines and Grunkle Stan. So, his memories of recent events come back much faster because they aren't his memories as Stanley Pines.

            They write, "The first memory that came back to Stan was Waddles, and he was living as Stanford Pines, or more specifically, Grunkle Stan, when he got that memory."</p>

        <div class="card">
          <p class="title">Stan Can Create False Memories In His Mind</p>
          <p>Whenever Stan types in the code on the vending machine, he always presses five buttons. In "Dreamscapers," however, he inputs a code that's different than usual. While this could be a continuity error, Tumblr user anistarrose points out that it could also be a way of tricking Bill. They suggest, "Stan is able to create false, illusory memories and scatter them through his mind like red herrings, especially with regards to memories about codes and passwords."

            After all, Stan knows that you can do anything you can imagine in your mind - so what if he is able to alter his memories? This user even points out that he uses his mind to deceive Bill in the finale - so who knows what else he's capable of?</p>

          <p class="title">The Bottomless Pit Is Really A Wormhole</p>
          <p>The "Bottomless Pit!" might seem like a silly filler episode - but what if there's actually more to it? Redditor /u/LapisUniverse suggests that it might not really be a bottomless pit. Instead, they believe it's a wormhole to a different dimension. They theorize, "I think the bottomless pit was an experiment by Ford. It may be a wormhole that leads to an alternate timeline when Bill doesn't take over."

            Ford does love impossible experiments, so it's possible that he could've created this odd wormhole. This theory suggests that everything that happens after they go into the bottomless pit happens in a dimension slightly different from the one they were in before.</p>

          <p class="title">The Time Baby And Time Guys Were Never Really Wiped Out</p>
          <p>Even though Bill is very powerful, it seems unlikely that he can really wipe out Time Baby and all the time travelers that easily. Redditor /u/avanish2004 suggests that perhaps they are only ended in that specific time, not in all of the timelines. After all, there needs to be someone to go around and repair time traveling mistakes.

            They write, "In the final episode, Bill uses his dimensional powers to destroy the universal baby and the time guys, so does he destroy them from the entire timeline? Not likely... These creatures could time travel again and again until they defeat him."</p>
